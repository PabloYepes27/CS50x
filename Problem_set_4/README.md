## Description:newspaper:

Implement a program called recover that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

Implement your program in a file called recover.c in a directory called recover.
Your program should accept exactly one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.
If your program is not executed with exactly one command-line argument, it should remind the user of correct usage, and main should return 1.
If the forensic image cannot be opened for reading, your program should inform the user as much, and main should return 1.
Your program, if it uses malloc, must not leak any memory.
